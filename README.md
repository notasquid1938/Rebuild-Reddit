## Rebuilding Reddit
This is a NextJS website that attempts to create as through as possible an archive of reddit. It accomplishes this by creating a convenient way to view all the content from Pushift's archives of Reddit's comments and submissions over the years.

## Long Term Goals
- [ ] Switch the database being used from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, its not an issue right now but anyone who want to actually use ALL of Reddit's data will inevitably run into a major database bottleneck
- [ ] Rebuild Imgur using [Archive Team's Backups](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_imgur) so that most image posts on reddit will be viewable
